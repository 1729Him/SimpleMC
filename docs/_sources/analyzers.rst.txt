**Analyzers**
=============

SimpleMC contains two types of analyzers :

   * Metropolis-Hastings.
      It is implemented in the **MCMCAnalyzer class**.

   


Also, for a previous quickly test, SuperMC have **MaxAnalyzer** that analyze the most probably values of the parameters.


Sampler comparison
-------------------

.. note:: 

   To verify the consistency of the parameter estimation among the different samplers available, we have made the following graph.

.. figure:: /img/samplersTriangle.png

     We estimates the posteriors of the parameters of the owaCDM model (dark energy with timedependent equation-of-state in a model of unknown curvature) using Supernovae type Ia, Cosmic Chronometers (Hubble Distance) and BAO .
